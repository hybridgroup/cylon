  # Commands

  ## abortMacro → (ID code , command number)

  Public: This command aborts any executing macro, and returns both it's ID code
  and the command number currently in progress.

  Returns an array containing the ID code and command number.

  ## abortOrbBasicProgram

  Public: Aborts execution of any currently-running orbBasic program.

  Returns null.

  ## appendMacroChunck(chunk)

  Public: Stores an attached macro definition into a temporary RAM buffer for
  later execution. It's similar to the `saveTemporaryMacro` function, but allows
  you to build up a longer temporary macros.

  - **chunk** - macro definition to be executed later. Will throw an
    error if any larger than 254 bytes.

  Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the macro could be packeted.

  ## appendOrbBasicFragment(area, programCode)

  Public: Appends a fragment of an orbBasic program to a buffer that will be
  written to the Sphero eventually.

  - **area** - value to start buffer with
  - **fragment** - fragment of orbBasic to be sent to the Sphero. Will throw an
    error if larger than 253 bytes

  Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the fragment could be packeted

  ## configureCollisionDetection(method, thresholdX, thresholdY, speedX, speedY, deadTime)

  Internal: Configures collision detection on the Sphero, using the provided
  params to decide what constitutes a 'collision'.

  - **method** - detection method to use. Pass `0x01` to enable collision detection
  - **thresholdX** - an 8-bit settable threshold for the X axis of the Sphero.
    A setting of `0x00` disables the contribution of this axis
  - **thresholdY** - an 8-bit settable threshold for the Y axis of the Sphero.
    A setting of `0x00` disables the contribution of this aYis
  - **speedX** - an 8-bit settable speed value for the X speed. This is ranged,
    then added to `thresholdX` to generate the final threshold value.
  - **speedY** - an 8-bit settable speed value for the Y speed. This is ranged,
    then added to `thresholdY` to generate the final threshold value.
  - **deadTime** - an 8-bit post-collision dead time to prevent re-triggering of
    the collision event. Specified in 10ms increments

  Returns a boolean whether or not the packet to be sent to the Sphero has been
  built successfully

  ## configureLocator(flag, x, y, yawTare)

  Public: Through the streaming interface, Sphero provides real-time location
  data in the form of X, Y coordinates on the ground plane.

      yaw tare value.
    - **y** - set the current X coordinates of Sphero on the ground plane in
      centimeters.
    - **x** - set the current Y coordinates of Sphero on the ground plane in
      centimeters.
    - **yawTare** - (0-359) value for the orientation the Sphero should use after
      calibration.

  Returns a boolean whether or not the packet to be sent to the Sphero has been
  built successfully
