  # Display Camera

  First, let's import Cylon:    

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon = require('cylon')

  Now that we have Cylon imported, we can start defining our robot

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon.robot

  Let's define the connections and devices:

      :::coffeescript
        connection:
          name: 'opencv', adaptor: 'opencv'

        devices: [
          { name: 'window', driver: 'window' }
          {
            name: 'camera',
            driver: 'camera',
            camera: 1,
            haarcascade: "\#{ __dirname }/examples/opencv/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml"
          } # Default camera is 0
        ]

  Now that Cylon knows about the necessary hardware we're going to be using, we'll
  tell it what work we want to do:

      :::coffeescript
        work: (my) ->
          my.camera.once('cameraReady', ->
            console.log('The camera is ready!')
            # We listen for frame ready event, when triggered
            # we display the frame/image passed as an argument
            # and we tell the window to wait 40 milliseconds
            my.camera.on('frameReady', (err, im) ->
              console.log("FRAMEREADY!")
              my.window.show(im, 40)
              #my.camera.readFrame()
            )
            # Here we have two options to start reading frames from
            # the camera feed.
            # 1. As fast as possible triggering the next frame read
            #    in the listener for frameReady, if you need video
            #    as smooth as possible uncomment #my.camera.readFrame()
            #    in the listener above and the one below this comment.
            #
            # my.camera.readFrame()
            #
            # 2. Use an interval of time to try and get aset amount
            #    of frames per second  (FPS), in the next example
            #    we are trying to get 1 frame every 50 milliseconds
            #    (20 FPS).
            #
            every 50, my.camera.readFrame
          )

  Now that our robot knows what work to do, and the work it will be doing that
  hardware with, we can start it:

      :::coffeescript
      .start()
