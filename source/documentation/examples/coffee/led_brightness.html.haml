  # LED Brightness

  For this example, we'll be using an LED on an Arduino board, and modifying it's
  brightness to make it fade in and out. Before we start, make sure you've got the
  `cylon-arduino` module installed.

  Let's start by importing Cylon:

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon = require 'cylon'

  Once we've got that, we can start defining our robot:

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon.robot

  We'll be using an Arduino, and communicating over the Firmata protocol. As well,
  we'll let our robot know about the LED we'll be modifying, on pin #3 of the
  Arduino.

      :::coffeescript
        connection: { name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' }
        device: { name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 3 }

  Next up, we'll define our robot's work:

      :::coffeescript
        work: (my) ->

  We'll set some variables here: brightness will represent the LED's brightness,
  from 1-255, and 'fade' will be the brightness change on each tick.

      :::coffeescript
          brightness = 0
          fade = 5

  Every 50 milliseconds, we'll be incrementing the brightness by `fade`'s value,
  setting the LED to that brightness, and reversing `fade`'s value if brightness
  hits 0 or 255.

      :::coffeescript
          every 0.05.seconds(), ->
            brightness += fade
            my.led.brightness(brightness)
            fade = -fade if (brightness is 0) or (brightness is 255)

  And with that done, we can now start our robot.

      :::coffeescript
      .start()
