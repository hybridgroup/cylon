  # Button

  For this example, we're going to be connecting to an Arduino, and when a putton
  on it's pressed, an LED will be toggled.

  Before you start this example, make sure you've got the `cylon-firmata` module
  installed.

  We'll get started by importing the Cylon module:

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon = require 'cylon'

  Now that we have Cylon imported, let's start making our robot:

      :::coffeescript
      Cylon.robot

  Our robot will have a connection to an Arduino, and communicate with it via the
  Firmata protocol:

      :::coffeescript
        connection: { name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' }

  This time, our robot will have two devices, an LED and a button:

      :::coffeescript
        devices: [
          { name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 13 },
          { name: 'button', driver: 'button', pin: 2 }
        ]

  Our robot has very simple work, it will just toggle the LED whenever the button
  sends the 'push' event:

      :::coffeescript
        work: (my) ->
          my.button.on 'push', -> my.led.toggle()

  And with all that done, we can start our robot:

      :::coffeescript
      .start()
