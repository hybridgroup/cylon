  # Keyboard

  For this Cylon example, we're going to quickly demonstrate getting keyboard
  input.

  First, let's import Cylon:

      :::javascript
      var Cylon = require('cylon');

  With that done, let's define our robot:

      :::javascript
      Cylon.robot({

  It will have a single connection and device, both to the keyboard.

      :::javascript
        connection: { name: 'keyboard', adaptor: 'keyboard' },
        device: { name: 'keyboard', driver: 'keyboard' },

  When we tell this robot to work, it's going to listen to the 'a' key on the
  keyboard and let us know when it's been pressed.

      :::javascript
        work: (my) function() {
          my.keyboard.on('a', function(key) { console.log "A PRESSED!" });
        }

  With that done, let's get started!

      :::javascript
      }).start();
