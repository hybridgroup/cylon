  # Sphero Messages

  For this Cylon example, we're going to hook up to a Sphero, and respond to
  a number of events the Sphero adaptor is capable of emitting. Before we get
  started, make sure you've got the `cylon-sphero` module installed.

  To get started, let's import the Cylon module:

      :::javascript
      var Cylon = require('cylon');

  With that set up, we can start defining our robot:

      :::javascript
      Cylon.robot({

  As with other Sphero examples, we'll have one connection and one device, both
  the same Sphero.

      :::javascript
        connection: { name: 'sphero', adaptor: 'sphero', port: '/dev/rfcomm0' },
        device: { name: 'sphero', driver: 'sphero' },

  And now we can start defining our robot's work.

      :::javascript
        work: function(me) {

  When the Sphero's connected, we want to set up collision detection and change
  it's color.

      :::javascript
          me.sphero.on('connect', function() {
            console.log("Setting up Collision Detection...");
            me.sphero.detectCollisions();
            me.sphero.setRGB(0x00FF00);
          });

  When the Sphero emits an 'update' event, we want to log the data it's provided
  to us:

      :::javascript
          me.sphero.on('update', function(data) {
            console.log("Update event eventName: " + data + " ");
            console.log("Update event args: ");
            console.log(data);
          });

  Similarly, when we get a message from the Sphero, we want to log the data, but
  we'll also change it's color while we're at it.

      :::javascript
          me.sphero.on('message', function(data) {
            me.sphero.setRGB(0x0000FF);
            console.log("Message:");
            console.log(data);
          });

  In the event of a collision, we want to change the color of the Sphero again, as
  well as logging the data provided by the collision event.

      :::javascript
          me.sphero.on('collision', function(data) {
            me.sphero.setRGB(0xFF0000);
            console.log("Collision:");
            console.log(data);
          });

  And, last but not least, when we get a notification event we want to record it's
  data and change the color.

      :::javascript
          me.sphero.on('notification', function(data) {
            me.sphero.setRGB(0xFF0000);
            console.log("Notification:");
            console.log(data);
          });
        }

  And with all that done, we can finally start the robot.

      :::javascript
      }).start();
