  # Sphero Collisions

  For this Cylon example, we're going to set up a Sphero such that it will change
  it's color and roll in a random direction when it has a collision.

  Before we get started, make sure you have the `cylon-sphero` module installed.

  First, let's load up Cylon:

      :::javascript
      var Cylon = require('cylon');

  With that loaded, we can begin defining our robot.

      :::javascript
      Cylon.robot({

  We're going to have one connection, and one device for this robot, both the same
  Sphero.

      :::javascript
        connection: { name: 'sphero', adaptor: 'sphero', port: '/dev/rfcomm0' },
        device: { name: 'sphero', driver: 'sphero' },

  With the necessary hardware defined, we can now start telling Cylon about the
  work our robot will be performing.

      :::javascript
        work: function(me) {

  We'll assign some variables here for later, a basic color for our sphero and
  a variable we'll use for a bitwise math operation later.

      :::javascript
          var color = 0x00FF00,
              bitFilter = 0xFFFF00;

  When our Sphero emits the 'connect' event, we're going to hook up collision
  detection, make sure it's not moving, and set a color.

      :::javascript
          me.sphero.on('connect', function() {
            console.log("Setting up Collision Detection...");
            me.sphero.detectCollisions();
            me.sphero.setRGB(color);
            me.sphero.stop();
          });

  And when our Sphero detects a collision, we want to notify the user of this via
  the console.

      :::javascript
          me.sphero.on('collision', function(data) {
            console.log("Collision:");

  We get the new color for a Sphero by doing a bitwise XOR operation on it, using
  the bitfilter above.

      :::javascript
            color = color ^ bitFilter;

  With our new color in hand, we can let the user know what color we're using now,
  and change the Sphero to that color. We'll also tell the Sphero to roll in
  a random direction, at speed 90.

      :::javascript
            console.log("Color: " + (color.toString(16)) + " ");
            me.sphero.setRGB(color);
            me.sphero.roll(90, Math.floor(Math.random() * 360));
          });
        }

  And with all that said and done, we can now start the robot.

      :::javascript
      }).start();
