  # Sphero

  For this Cylon example, we're going to politely ask a Sphero to roll in a random
  direction, and to change it's direction every second. Before we get started,
  make sure you've got the `cylon-sphero` module installed.

  First, let's import Cylon:

      :::javascript
      var Cylon = require('cylon');

  With that done, we can now start defining our robot:

      :::javascript
      Cylon.robot({

  We'll be using one connection and one device, both the Sphero.

      :::javascript
        connection: { name: 'sphero', adaptor: 'sphero', port: '/dev/rfcomm0' },
        device: { name: 'sphero', driver: 'sphero' },

  The work for this robot is pretty straight-forward. Every second, we're going to
  tell the Sphero to roll at speed `60`, in a random direction.

      :::javascript
        work: function(me) {
          every((1).second(), function() {
            me.sphero.roll(60, Math.floor(Math.random() * 360));
          });
        }

  Simple enough. And with that done, we can now tell the robot to start working:

      :::javascript
      }).start();
