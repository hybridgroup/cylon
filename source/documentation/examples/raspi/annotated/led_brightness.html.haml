  # Raspberry Pi - LED Brightness

  For this example, we'll be using an LED on a Raspberry Pi board, and modifying it's
  brightness to make it fade in and out. Before we start, make sure you've got the
  `cylon-raspi` module installed.

  Let's start by importing Cylon:

      :::javascript
      var Cylon = require('cylon');

  Once we've got that, we can start defining our robot:

      :::javascript
      Cylon.robot({

  We'll be using a Raspberry Pi as our connection. As well, we'll let our robot
  know about the LED we'll be modifying, on pin #11 of the Raspberry Pi.

      :::javascript
        connection: { name: 'raspi', adaptor: 'raspi', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' },
        device: { name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 11 },

  Next up, we'll define our robot's work:

      :::javascript
        work: function(my) {

  We'll set some variables here: brightness will represent the LED's brightness,
  from 1-255, and 'fade' will be the brightness change on each tick.

      :::javascript
          var brightness = 0,
              fade = 5;

  Every 50 milliseconds, we'll be incrementing the brightness by `fade`'s value,
  setting the LED to that brightness, and reversing `fade`'s value if brightness
  hits 0 or 255.

      :::javascript
          every(0.05.seconds(), function() {
            brightness += fade;
            my.led.brightness(brightness);
            if ((brightness === 0) || (brightness === 255)) { fade = -fade; }
          });
        }

  And with that done, we can now start our robot.

      :::javascript
      }).start();
