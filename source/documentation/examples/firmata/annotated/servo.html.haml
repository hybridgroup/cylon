  # Servo

  For this example, similar in structure to the led_brightness example, we're
  going to take an Arduino, and modify the angle of an attached servo such that
  it's continually turning back and forth.

  Before we get started, make sure to have the `cylon-arduino` module installed.

  First, let's require Cylon:

      :::javascript
      var Cylon = require('cylon');

  Now we can start defining our robot:

      :::javascript
      Cylon.robot({

  We'll be connecting to an Ardunio, using the Firmata protocol, and a servo
  attached to the Arduino on pin 3. We have the option to pass an extra 'range'
  param to the device, this param sets the min and max angle values. By default
  this is set to min: 30, max: 150 to prevent damaging the servo when giving it
  an angle outside the range it can cover.

      :::javascript
        connection: { name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' },
        device: { name: 'servo', driver: 'servo', pin: 3, range: { min: 30, max: 150 } },

  We'll start defining the work for our robot next:

      :::javascript
        work: function(my) {

  We'll define variables to hold our servo's angle, and the rate at which that
  angle will change:

      :::javascript
          var angle = 30;
          var increment = 40;

  Every second, we'll increment the `angle`, set the servo to run at that angle,
  and log the angle we're running at to the console. We'll also make sure to
  change the increment if the angle is at the upper/lower bounds of the values
  supported:

      :::javascript
          every((1).seconds(), function() {
            angle += increment;
            my.servo.angle(angle);

            console.log("Current Angle: " + (my.servo.currentAngle()));

            if ((angle === 30) || (angle === 150)) { increment = -increment; }
          });
        }

  And with all that done, we can now start our robot:

      :::javascript
      }).start();
