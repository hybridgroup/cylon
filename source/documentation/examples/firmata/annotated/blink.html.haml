  # Blink

  For this very basic Cylon example, we're just going to hook up to an Arduino and
  blink an LED on it with a one-second interval.

  To get started, let's load up Cylon:

      :::javascript
      var Cylon = require('cylon');

  With Cylon loaded, we can now define our basic robot.

      :::javascript
      Cylon.robot({

  Our robot has one connection, to an Arduino using the `cylon-firmata` adaptor:

      :::javascript
        connection: { name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' },

  Our robot also only has one device (or at least only one we're concerned about),
  an LED on pin 13.

      :::javascript
        device: { name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 13 },

  Next, we'll define the robot's work, which will be toggling the LED every
  second:

      :::javascript
        work: function(my) {
          every((1).second(), my.led.toggle);
        }

  And that's all the parts of our robot. All that's left is to start it.

      :::javascript
      }).start();
