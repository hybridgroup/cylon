  # Motor

  For this example, similar in structure to the led_brightness example, we're
  going to take an Arduino, and modify the speed of an attached motor such that it
  continually speeds up and slows down.

  Before we get started, make sure to have the `cylon-arduino` module installed.

  First, let's require Cylon:

      :::javascript
      var Cylon = require('cylon');

  Now we can start defining our robot:

      :::javascript
      Cylon.robot({

  We'll be connecting to an Ardunio, using the Firmata protocol, and a motor
  attached to the Arduino on pin 3.

      :::javascript
        connection: { name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' },
        device: { name: 'motor', driver: 'motor', pin: 3 },

  We'll start defining the work for our robot next:

      :::javascript
        work: function(my) {

  We'll define variables to hold our motor's speed, and the rate at which that
  speed will change:

      :::javascript
          var speed = 0,
              increment = 5;

  Every fifty milliseconds, we'll increment the `speed`, set the motor to run at
  that speed, and log the speed we're running at to the console. We'll also make
  sure to change the increment if the speed is at the upper/lower bounds of the
  values supported:

      :::javascript
          every(0.05.seconds(), function() {
            speed += increment;
            my.motor.speed(speed);

            console.log("Current Speed: " + (my.motor.currentSpeed()));

            if ((speed === 0) || (speed === 255)) { increment = -increment; }
          });

  And with all that done, we can now start our robot:

      :::javascript
      }).start();
