  # LED Brightness

  For this example, we'll be using an LED on an Arduino board, and modifying it's
  brightness to make it fade in and out. Before we start, make sure you've got the
  `cylon-arduino` module installed.

  Let's start by importing Cylon:

      :::javascript
      var Cylon = require('cylon');

  Once we've got that, we can start defining our robot:

      :::javascript
      Cylon.robot({

  We'll be using an Arduino, and communicating over the Firmata protocol. As well,
  we'll let our robot know about the LED we'll be modifying, on pin #3 of the
  Arduino.

      :::javascript
        connection: { name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' },
        device: { name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 3 },

  Next up, we'll define our robot's work:

      :::javascript
        work: function(my) {

  We'll set some variables here: brightness will represent the LED's brightness,
  from 1-255, and 'fade' will be the brightness change on each tick.

      :::javascript
          var brightness = 0,
              fade = 5;

  Every 50 milliseconds, we'll be incrementing the brightness by `fade`'s value,
  setting the LED to that brightness, and reversing `fade`'s value if brightness
  hits 0 or 255.

      :::javascript
          every(0.05.seconds(), function() {
            brightness += fade;
            my.led.brightness(brightness);
            if ((brightness === 0) || (brightness === 255)) { fade = -fade; }
          });
        }

  And with that done, we can now start our robot.

      :::javascript
      }).start();
