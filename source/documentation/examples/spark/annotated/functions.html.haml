  # Spark Core - Functions

  In this example, we're going to tell the Spark Core to run a function, and tell
  us what it returns. To do this, we'll need to load some custom firmware onto the
  Spark. You can do this via Spark's [Built tool](https://spark.io/build), or
  using the `cylon spark upload` command that comes with cylon-spark.

  For more info on the `cylon spark upload` command, please see the `cylon-spark`
  README: [https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-spark#upload]()

  Either way, upload [this script][script] to your Spark Core before you get
  started.

  [script]: https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-spark/blob/master/examples/functions/functions.cpp

  To begin, let's load up Cylon:

      :::javascript
      var Cylon = require('cylon');

  With that done, we can begin to setup our robot:

      :::javascript
      Cylon.robot({

  Our robot has one connection, which we'll call `spark`. It uses the Spark
  adaptor, and has our Spark access token and the device id from our core:

      :::javascript
        connection: {
          name: 'spark',
          adaptor: 'spark',
          accessToken: '[YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN]',
          deviceId: '[YOUR_DEVICE_ID]'
        },

  For our robot's work, we're going to tell it to execute the `fortyTwo` function
  on our Spark every five seconds, and print the return value the function returns.

      :::javascript
        work: function(my) {
          every((5).seconds(), function() {
            my.spark.command("fortyTwo", [], function(err, data) {
              if (err) {
                console.log("An error occured!", err);
              } else {
                console.log("The magic number is:", data);
              }
            });
          });
        }

  With our connection to the Spark and work defined, all that's left is to tell
  the robot to start:

      :::javascript
      }).start();
