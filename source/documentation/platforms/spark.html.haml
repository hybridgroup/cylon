  .info-intro
    %p The Spark Core contains a Wi-Fi connected microcontroller. Once it connects to a Wi-Fi network, it automatically connects with a central server (the "Spark Cloud") and stays connected so it can be controlled from external systems, such as a Cylon.js program.

%section.how-to#HowToInstall
  %h2 How To Install
  %p Installing Cylon.js with Spark support is pretty easy.
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        npm install cylon-spark

  %p
    You'll need your <code>access_token</code> and <code>device_id</code> to push new software to your Spark, and you can get both of these from Spark's
    = link_to "Build tool", "https://spark.io/build", target: :blank

  %ul
    %li <code>access_token:</code> In the Build tool, click on the Settings cog in the bottom-left corner to find your access token.
    %li <code>device_id:</code> After you have your Spark Core registered to your account through the Tinker app, click on the Cores section (just above the Settings cog) on the Build tool. Then, click on the arrow next to your core's name to get its device ID.
  
  %h2 Installing Firmware On Your Spark Core
  %p You will need to install the appropriate firmware on your Spark Core to use it from Cylon.js.
  %p 
    One option is to use the Tinker software, which has the same API as the "default.cpp" code that is included with the Gort CLI 
    = link_to "(http://gort.io).", "http://gort.io" 
    This routes all of your calls thru the Spark cloud, with is appropriate for communicating with Spark devices in a remote location.
  %p Another option is to use the VoodooSpark firmware, which has its own binary API. This discovers your device thru the Spark cloud, and then routes all of your calls directly to the Spark Core device. This is appropriate for communicating with Spark devices on the same local subnet as the computer that you wish to control them from.
  %h2 Uploading
  %h3 Uploading Code To Your Spark Core Using the Cylon CLI

  :markdown
        :::bash
        $ cylon spark upload [access_token] [device_id] new_firmware.cpp

  %p The <code>cylon spark upload</code> command can help if you want to upload new source code directly to your Spark Core.

  %h2 How To Use
  %h3 Spark using Tinker API:
  :markdown
        :::javascript
        var Cylon = require('cylon');

        // Initialize the robot
        Cylon.robot({
          connection: { name: 'spark', adaptor: 'spark', accessToken: 'XYZPDQ123', deviceId: '123ABC456' },
          device: {name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 'D0'},

          work: function(my) {
            every((1).second(), function() {my.led.toggle()});
          }
        }).start();
  %h3 Spark using VoodooSpark API:
  :markdown
        :::javascript
        var Cylon = require('cylon');

        // Initialize the robot
        Cylon.robot({
          connection: { name: 'voodoospark', adaptor: 'voodoospark', accessToken: 'XYZPDQ123', deviceId: '123ABC456', module: 'spark' },
          device: {name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 'D0'},

          work: function(my) {
            every((1).second(), function() {my.led.toggle()});
          }
        }).start();

  <strong>Note:</strong> In addition to the above methods, the Spark adaptor supports the full GPIO pin interface, as long as you are using Tinker, or a Tinker compatible program running on the Spark itself.


%section.how-to#HowToConnect
  %h2 How to Connect
  %p
    You don't actually need to setup anything in your computer to be able to connect to the Spark,
    just make sure you have a working internet connection and go through the process of setting up
    you board, by following the Getting started guide in the
    %a{ href: "www.spark.io" } Spark.io
    site, that way you'll be able to obtain your token and device id, needed to connect Cylon.js to
    the Spark. You can follow the instructiona to acoomplish this by clicking in the link below.

  %h2 Drivers

  %p Available drivers for the spark platform are listed below, the drivers contain detailed documentation and examples of what kinds of physical computing (using Cylon.js and Node.js) you can be doing:
